############## IMPACT ##############

IMPACT (Identifies Multiple Peaks and Counts Transcripts) is a gene 
expression quantification method for TAGseq experiments developed 
by Bradley Jenner for his Undergraduate Honors Thesis at  UC Davis. 
It is C++ tool that can take advantage of multiple threads and is my
first attempt at building a high performing Bioinformatics tool.
It uses assumptions made about the distribution of sequencing reads
along the 3' UTR of a gene to group reads and assign their combined 
read count to the gene whose annotation the cluster overlaps. 

This tool is still very much in development. It relies partially
on the bamtools and seqan C++ libraries, although mainly for parsing
and manipulating bam and gtf files. This reliance will be revisited in
future versions along with implementing an improved clustering 
algorithm to improve read groupings and their gene assignment.

################### USAGE ################### 
    
   impact [input.sorted.bam] [annotation.gtf|annotation.gff] [options]

DESCRIPTION:
    
   Identifies expressed transcripts using clusters of mapped reads from TAGseq experiments.
   Generates a counts file written to stdout and optionally a GTF file of identified read clusters.

PARAMETERS:

    -h, --help
          Display the help message.

    -t, --threads INTEGER
          Number of processes for multithreading. Default: 1.

    -l, --library-type STRING
          Library type. Paired end is not recommended. Only used to check proper pairing. One of
          single and paired. Default: single.

    -s, --strandedness STRING
          Strandedness of library. One of forward and reverse. Default: forward.

    -n, --nonunique-alignments
          Count primary and secondary read alignments.

    -q, --mapq-min INTEGER
          Minimum mapping quality score to consider for counts. Default: 1.

    -f, --feature-tag STRING
          Name of feature tag. Default: exon.

    -i, --feature-id STRING
          ID of feature (use for GFFs). Default: gene_id.

    -o, --output-gtf STRING
          Output read cluster GTF file and specify name.

    --version
          Display version information.
